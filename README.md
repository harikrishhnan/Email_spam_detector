# Spam Detector


## Overview

This project implements a simple and effective spam detector using machine learning techniques. The detector is trained on a dataset of emails, and it can classify messages as spam or legitimate (ham) based on their content.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Spam Detector, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (>=3.0)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, if you want to explore the code interactively)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JosanGeorge/Spam-Detector.git
cd Spam-Detector
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file: [Spam Detector.ipynb](link_to_jupyter_notebook)
2. Run each section of the notebook to understand the code and train the spam detector.
3. Optionally, explore the datasets provided in the `datasets` directory.
4. Use the trained model to classify emails as spam or ham.

## Files and Directory Structure

- **Spam Detector.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the spam detector.
- **datasets/**
  - **emails_dataset.csv**: Default dataset used for training and testing.
  - *Replace this file with your own dataset if you have one.*
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Datasets

The project comes with a default dataset (`datasets/emails_dataset.csv`), but you are encouraged to replace it with your own data for training and testing. If you have your own dataset, simply replace the existing CSV file with your dataset, making sure it has the same structure.
